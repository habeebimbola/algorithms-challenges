The exercises in this project aim to solve Algorithmic questions from Coding platforms.
The aim is to strengthen problem solving skills and improve quick thinking.

Result is correct with a simple data set: {7 5 9 1 4} -> 1

It works when inputs contains only negative numbers: : {-15 -7 -9 -14 -12} -> -7
Problem solving

It works with two negative temperatures that are equal: {-10 -10} -> -10
Problem solving
+35 pts
The solution displays 0 if no temperature
